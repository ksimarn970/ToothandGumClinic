                    <p>Nowadays, everyone is very familiar with the word Root canal treatment, which is also called RCT. When someone hears that they require a root canal treatment, the first thought that comes to mind is multiple long sitting appointments with lots of pain. Still, with continued research and newer technology, multiple visits to endodontics shift to a single sitting root canal.</p>
