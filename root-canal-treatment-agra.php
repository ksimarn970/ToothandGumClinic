                    <h2>Root Canal Treatment</h2>
                    <p>As per a general conception, the knees of many individuals quake upon knowing about <strong>Root Canal</strong>, but this is not true when it comes to Root canal treatment. At <a href="https://toothandgumclinic.com/" > Tooth and Gum Dental Clinic </a>, you have the highest success rate, and apart from this, the procedure is painless. </p>

                    <h2>RCT</h2>
                    <p>Root canal therapy comes in the category of endodontic therapy. In this particular dental treatment, our oral specialists and surgeons eradicate the infection from the interior of the mouth. Another motive of RCT at Tooth and Gum Clinic is to provide a firewall to prevent infections in the tooth. This therapy is carried on the tooth pulp, also referred to as the root canal.</p>

                    <h2>Interesting facts about RCT</h2>
                    <p>During your appointment with our <a href="https://toothandgumclinic.com/" > dental surgeon in Agra </a>, you will come across some interesting facts about this treatment. Some of these are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. RCT is used to eradicate nerves from the tooth pulp.</li>
                        <li>2. Though you carry the concept that this therapy is painful, it is a pain-relieving therapy.</li>
                        <li>3. The procedure that takes place in RCT is also referred to as endodontic therapy.</li>
                        <li>4. There will be variations in the costs when it comes to RCT. However, this therapy comes with a lesser cost if you compare this procedure with tooth eradication and subsequent replacement with the crown or bridge.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                    
                
                    <h2>RCT concept</h2>
                    <p>Know that a root canal is not a treatment, in fact, but it is a portion of the tooth. It comprises a hollow section of the tooth consisting of the nerve tissue and blood vessels apart from other cells, also referred to as pulp.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      
                    <p>The tooth comprises a crown and roots. The location of the crown is above the gum, but the roots are below it. The roots link the tooth to the jawbone. Inside the crown and the tooth, also called the root canal, is the pulp. This endodontic therapy means  <strong>Inside The Tooth</strong>.</p>
                   
                    </blockquote>
                    <h2>Root Canal Treatment in Tooth and Gum Clinic</h2>
                    <p>At <a href="https://toothandgumclinic.com/" > Tooth and Gum Dental Clinic  </a> , you will get a new lease on life and freedom from long-lasting toothache with the RCT procedure. Our dental specialist will offer painless root canal treatment in Agra.</p>
                    <h2>Steps for RCT</h2>
                    <p>Our dental specialist at Tooth and Gum Clinic, Agra and Delhi, will offer the RCT in the following steps:</p>
                    <h4>1. Cleansing the root canal : </h4>
                    <p>The oral specialist will remove everything inside the root canal. Our dental specialist will apply local anesthesia on the portion of the tooth. After this, the dental surgeon will drill the access hole on the tooth surface, subsequently eradicating the diseased or dead tissue.</p>
                    
                    <h4>2. Filling : </h4>
                    <p>The dental specialist will cleanse, craft, and decontaminate the hollow region by making use of tiny files as well as irrigation solutions. After this, our specialist at Tooth and Gum Clinic will fill the canals with the help of a rubber-like material by making use of adhesive cement to seal them fully.</p>
                    <p>After the completion of the root canal therapy, the patient does not feel the pain because the very cause of the pain is gone. The nerve tissue is eradicated, thereby eliminating the infection.</p>
                    <h4>3. Addition Of Crown or Filling :</h4>
                    <p>After the completion of RCT, the fragility of the tooth increases. The tooth, which is comprised of no pulp, gets nourishment from the ligament connecting the tooth to the bone. But with time, the brittleness increases, so the crown or filling offers protection.</p>
                    <p>Till the completion of the crown or filling, the patient should not bite or chew using the tooth.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Appointment at Tooth and Gum Clinic</h2>
                    <p>For painless root canal treatment in Agra and Delhi, you generally have to come for one appointment. But for curved canals, multi-canals, or heavy infections, you may require one or two additional appointments.</p>
